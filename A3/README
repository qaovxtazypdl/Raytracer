Compilation:
=============
No changes to default. Please note that I did add new files, so premake4 gmake is necessary

Manual:
=============
I assumed that orientation rotation is global on the model.
I put the GUI elements inside a top-of-screen menu.
I assumed that we should be in false color mode for the entire duration of when we are in joint select/manipulation mode.
  When selecting joints, black means not a valid selection, white means already selected, and any other color should be selectable nodes.

I added a new undo/redo stack data structure in StateStack.hpp.
JointNode now has a z component of rotation, which is only used for the head rotation. This is initialized at runtime.
JointNode now has state variables to keep track of current rotation, and a setter of sort to apply changes to these variables.
GeometryNode now has two vec3 color fields, set at runtime after lua script is loaded.
  These are the colors that the node maps to for joint selection (deselected and selected colors)
I added a vector containing all the JointNode *s in the loaded tree for easier iteration.

My hierarchical model of the puppet (its a bird) centers the root at the "torso". There is a node above it that manipulates
  its translation and orientation transformations, as well a node above that acting as the root, making scaling and z-transformations
  to bring it into the viewing area. The torso has neck, shoulder and abdomen as its children. The neck as things such as
  head, eyes, beak as it's descendants, the shoulder has the two wings and feathers, and the abdomen has the legs, claws, and tail
  as its descendants. For a more detailed picture of this, please see hierarchy.png in this directory.
