To compile the program (no changes to default):
==============================================
cd A1
premake4 gmake
make

Compiled and tested on personal computer and gl23.



Manual:
===============================================
I assumed that reset should also reset the color radio button choice, as well as any colors that were adjusted manually.
I also added the ability to rotate in the vertical direction about the central axis using a corresponding mouse movement in the y direction to make it more flexible.
