To compile the program (no changes to default):
==============================================
cd A1
premake4 gmake
make

Compiled and tested on personal computer and gl07.



Manual:
===============================================
I assumed that reset should also reset the color radio button choice, as well as any colors that were adjusted manually.
I assumed that when moving the grid over a cell that is colored differently than the current selected color, we immediately apply the new color to the stack, instead of switching the current color.
I also added the ability to rotate in the vertical direction about the central axis using a corresponding mouse movement in the y direction to make it more flexible.
I also implemented a simple "animation" when manipulating block. The animation will immediately terminate if a new block in the same square is manipulated when the previous block is still animating.
