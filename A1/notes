convert to uniforms and individual cube stack buffers??? worth it???
	- allocate buffer as array of DIM*DIM buffers and initialize
	- change stack drawing to only draw one cube stack at a time.
	- draw outline stacks one at a time as well

	remove total cubes
	use separate buffer for active outline
