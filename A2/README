To compile the program (no changes to default):
==============================================
cd A2
premake4 gmake
make

Compiled and tested on personal computer and gl29.

Manual:
===============================================
My default FOV is 60, and I assumed that to get the cube to initially show up inside the frustrum, I could initially translate the view 4 units back.
I added some more debug info into the status lines. R,L,T,B are the NDC positions of the viewport.
I assumed that for the purposes of this assignment, the aspect ratio should always be 1.0f regardless of window size.
