Compilation
=====================================
premake4 gmake
make

(same as before)

tested on gl07.student.cs

Manual
=====================================
NOTE: I prepended Assets/ to all objects loaded inside the lua scripts, so that running ./A4 in the A4 directory, pointing
  to a lua file inside Assets/ will load the objects correctly. PLEASE RUN IN A4 DIRECTORY, not A4/Assets. (eg. ./A4 Assets/sample.lua)
  I assumed that we could use dvec, dmat4, double ... etc to help reduce numerical error.

Extra feature: recursive reflection.
  Sends out secondary rays from specular surfaces and recursively raytraces the scene down to a depth of at max 10.
  This provides a decent rendering of reflective surfaces.
  Scene: It's a ground plane with small reflectivity, and two mirror plane instances perpendicular to the plane.
    The mirror instances consist of a highly reflective plane, and a cylinder mesh at the edge.
    The mirror instances are set up at an angle so that rays entering will reflect multiple times between them.
    In between is a shrine of some sort, containing a metallic sphere in the middle, surrounded by four smaller
    spheres of varying material, and a statue/trophy in the middle. A cow on a red carpet is staring at the trophy.
    On the lower side of the image, there is a nonhierarchical sphere and box on the ground beside the carpet.
    The scene has three light sources. One directly on top, one directly behind eye, and the strongest one on a light angle from the top.

  -sample (original scene)
  -hier, instance, macho-cows, nonhier, simple, simple-cows, macho-cows-bb (bounding box special render)
  -also included are versions of the above files with the -nref prefix, which are rendered without reflection.
  -also included are versions of the above files with the -nstar prefix, which are rendered without starfield, for
    easier time distinguishing between a star and a glitched fleck (not that there are any).
