Manual
=====================================
NOTE: I prepended Assets/ to all objects loaded inside the lua scripts, so that running ./A4 in the A4 directory, pointing
  to a lua file inside Assets/ will load the objects correctly.
  I assumed that we could use dvec, dmat4, double ... etc to help reduce numerical error.

Extra feature: recursive reflection.
  Sends out secondary rays from specular surfaces and recursively raytraces the scene down to a depth of at max 10.
  This provides a decent rendering of reflective surfaces.
  Scene: It's a ground plane with small reflectivity, and two mirror plane instances perpendicular to the plane.
    The mirror instances consist of a highly reflective plane, and a cylinder mesh at the edge.
    The mirror instances are set up at an angle so that rays entering will reflect multiple times between them.
    In between is a shrine of some sort, containing a metallic ball in the middle, surrounded by four smaller
    balls of varying material, and a statue/trophy in the middle. A cow on a red carpet is staring at the trophy.
    On the lower side of the image, there is a nonhierarchical sphere and box on the ground beside the carpet.
