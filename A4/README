=====================================
premake4 gmake
make

(same as before)


Manual
=====================================
NOTE: I prepended Assets/ to all objects loaded inside the lua scripts, so that running ./A4 in the A4 directory, pointing
  to a lua file inside Assets/ will load the objects correctly.


Extra feature: recursive reflection.
  Sends out secondary rays from specular surfaces and recursively raytraces the scene down to a depth of at max 10.
  This provides a decent rendering of reflective surfaces.
  Scene:


--Screenshot saved in screenshot.jpg (my original scene)
--Sample renderings saved under Assets/
  -hier, instance, macho-cows, nonhier, simple, simple-cows, macho-cows-bb (bounding box special render)
  -sample (original scene)
  -also included are files with the -nr prefix, which are rendered without reflection.
