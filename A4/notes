mesh/cube collision

advanced:
hierachy
bounding volumes
extra feature (supersampling?)
scene


bugs:
phong shading coefficients
falloff of light







hacks - should fix:
==================================
"backface light culling"/shitty epsilon sphere
color min with vec(1 1 1)/crappy color addition of lighting as well
