advanced:
hierachy
bounding volumes
scene


bugs:
cube and mesh not working / optimize triangle routines
non square screen
ambient phong/how to use coeffs

test case:
light source behind triangle
diffuse on back face



hacks - should fix:
==================================
multiplying k_d in multiple times
"backface light culling"/shitty epsilon sphere/discard roots in a better way
