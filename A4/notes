advanced:
hierachy
bounding volumes
extra feature (supersampling?)
scene


bugs:
cube and mesh not working / optimize triangle routines
non square screen


test case:
light source behind triangle
diffuse on back face



hacks - should fix:
==================================
"backface light culling"/shitty epsilon sphere/discard roots in a better way
assets directory hardcoded
